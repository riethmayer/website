h1. Website

A Ruby on Rails blogging app for the fashionable developer.

That was the way it's been called by Xavier, who did a great job.

I added YUI, HAML, SASS, and the DISQUS comment engine and removed Cucumber, the comment model and the exception notifier, as I prefer hoptoad.

I will miss the preview for comments, and the nice code-highlighting for the moment, but this might be added in near future.

h2. Quick Start

<pre><code>  git clone git://github.com/riethmayer/website.git website
  cd enki
  git checkout -b myblog # Create a new work branch
  cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
  # Edit config/enki.yml, config/3rd_party_apps.yml, disqus.yml and config/database.yml to taste
  rake db:migrate
  rake spec
  ./script/server
  # Load http://localhost:3000/admin in your browser</code></pre>

Maybe you'd like to fork "enki at github":http://github.com/xaviershay/enki/tree/master instead and do your own hacking :)

h2. More info

See Enki's more info context. This version lacks in 
* Live comment preview 
* Google does search better than you or I (I'd like to take the challenge to implement a decent search)

And I totally agree with

* Hacking code is the easiest way to customize something


h2. Contributors, these guys rock
